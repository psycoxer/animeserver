# AnimeServer

A super simple anime server make to run on extremely old devices. (Specifically made for playing anime on my iPad 2 running ios 9.3.5).
It provides a simple search and episode selection opition and plays the `m3u8` link in `VLC` using the `vlc://` uri.

Based on [Consumet.ts](https://github.com/consumet/consumet.ts)
